# About Us
Since early 2020, the AAPI (Asian-American and Pacific Islander) community has borne the brunt of the blame concerning the global pandemic. Media representation plays an important role in learning—and unlearning—racist stereotypes that harm the AAPI community. Tagaini is a new media platform redefining AAPI representation.
